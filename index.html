                <h3>Ransomware: Should organizations pay or not?</h3>
                <h4>Ransomware, Cryptography</h4>
                <p>Short Answer: no<br>
                    Long Answer: <br>When a company becomes the victim of ransomware, they often have ways around it, a common way is to fall back to
                    a recent backup, but what if that doesnt work, what if after all their fall backs, nothing works; a company then has to make two choices
                    <br>pay or dont pay?<br>
                    up front pay the attacker might be the quickest and easier solution, in a world where downtime=lost revenue, paying can look attractive, but that couldnt be more wrong
                    Paying the attacker can essentially tell the attacker that you are an easy target, one that also pays, if they got into your system they could do it again "but what if I harden my system", creating a back-door is a common action in the hacker playbook, in that case hardening your system wont help
                    Long story short, its better to no pay the hacker, tell them you wont "bend the knee", and look for a proper solution, there are plenty of companies who specalize and getting your access back

                <h3>Are humans really the weakest link in security?</h3>
                <h4>Multi-factor Authentication, Password, Phishing</h4>
                <p>
                    In today's world having an account for every IOT service we use is becoming the norm, I mean just the other day, I went to a restaurant that had you scan a QR code for the menu, and the first thing they did was ask you to create an account with them.
                    So it's no wonder people use short and easy to remember passwords, that they use everywhere, but you dont need to go far to be told that is a massive problem
                    Attackers can use use wordlists, precompiled lists of common passwords that can take the work out of bruteforcing a password, these wordlists can be used with low-end hardware aswell, lowering the bar of entry, so what the recommendation, long complicated passwords that look like something out of a sci-fi movie
                    <br><br>Unfortunatly thats also not the only thing you have to be worried about, im sure by now everyone has head of the nigerian prince scam, we all like to laugh and say, "I would never fall for that", but their not all that simple, some are complicated, using publicly available sources
                     to find information on you and your peers and kin, then they craft a story, pretend to be family, or your works I.T. Department, and they ask you your password, thinking its safe you give it to them, "why would it be dangerous to give my facebook password to great aunt linda?", but now 
                     your account is compromised, passwords and emails are changed, and you've unknowingly just lost your facebook account
